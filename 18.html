<ul>
<li>A fox walked in front with his head raised high and his expression proud and confident. Behind him was a mighty tiger,which looked a little low-key and kept a certain distance. The fox's posture was elegant and its tail swung lightly. The tiger lowered its head slightly and its tail was slightly sandwiched behind it. The background was forest or mountain field,showing a majestic and interesting scene. There were some shadows behind the fox,it symbolizes the power of the tiger</li>
